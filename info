Classification of host star:

- G-type main sequence star (yellow dwarf)

A Class G star is the fifth-brightest type of main sequence star. They are typically described as yellow or yellow-white. They made up roughly 8% of all main-sequence stars.
A typical Class G star has a mass of 0.9 (0.8 to 1.04) solar masses, a radius of 1.05 (0.96 to 1.15) solar radii, a luminosity of 1 (0.6 to 1.5) solar luminosity, a surface temperature of 5,600 K (5,200 K to 6,000 K), and a lifespan of 10 to 15 billion years.Their habitable zones range from ~0.6 to 1 AU, and their long lifespans and relatively high brightness means they are very good candidates for life-bearing planets. Earth's sun is a class G star, actually, as are many stars with known extrasolar planets.
Class G stars can be described as "Sun-like" as their properties such as mass, radius, luminosity, temperature, and colour are often fair similar to that of the Sun's. G-type main sequence stars are often called "yellow dwarfs", though the name is somewhat of a misnomer as it can imply that Class G main-sequence stars are yellow in colour and relatively small compared with "typical" stars. G-type main sequence stars range in colour from white to very slightly yellow and are much larger, brighter, and more massive than the vastly more common Class M and Class K stars.

- K-type main sequence star (orange dwarf)

A Class K star is the sixth-brightest type of main sequence star. They are typically colored yellow-orange or orange. They make up roughly 12% of all main-sequence stars.
A typical Class K star has a mass of 0.6 (0.45 to 0.8) solar masses, a radius of 0.8 (0.7 to 0.96) solar radii, a luminosity of 0.3 (0.08 to 0.6) solar luminosities, a surface temperature of 4,450 K (3,700 K to 5,200 K), and a lifespan of 50 to 100 billion years.
With their extremely long lifespans and acceptable brightness, it is very likely that many Class K stars have life-bearing planets, and many exoplanets have been discovered around stars of this class.
Compared to stars like the Sun, K-type stars are generally notably smaller, cooler, less massive, and less luminous. Their small size and cooler temperatures are factors towards them being alternatively known as "orange dwarfs". 


- M-type main sequence star (red dwarf)

A Class M star is the type that consists of some of the dimmest of the main sequence stars. Such main sequence Class M stars are known as red dwarfs, they are typically described as red or red-orange. They are by far the most common type of luminous star, making up roughly 76% of all main sequence stars.
A typical Class M star has a mass of 0.20 (0.08 to 0.45) solar masses (M☉), a radius of 0.3 (≤0.7) solar radii, a luminosity of 0.01 (≤0.08) solar luminosities, a surface temperature of 3,000 K (2,400 K to 3,790 K), and a lifespan of 1 to 10 trillion years.
Although they have very long lifespans, red dwarfs' low mass and luminosity (and their habitable zones of about 0.1 AU) means that many planets will end up frozen or tidally locked to their parent star; these are generally not good conditions for intelligent life. However, it may be possible or even common for simple life to develop on these planets.


- B-type main sequence star

A Class B star is the second-brightest type of main sequence star. They are typically colored blue-white, slightly less blue than O-type stars. They are fairly rare, making up only 0.13% of main-sequence stars.
A typical Class B star has a mass of 9 (2 to 16) solar masses, a radius of 4 (2 to 7) solar radii, a luminosity of 1,000 (25 to 30,000) solar luminosities, a surface temperature of 44,310 F or 24,599 C (17,540 F to 53,540 F), and a lifespan of 50,000,000–100,000,000 years. The cores of B-type stars are estimated to be around 50,000,000 K (90,000,000°F).
The habitable zone of a typical Class B star is on the order of 50 AU. While they also possess short lifespans, making planets and life rare, there are a few examples of B-type star systems, including HIP 78530.
